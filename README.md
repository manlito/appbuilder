AppBuilder
==========

A kind of BPM for Small Business that helps you from design and up to deployment.

This app was made in order to help others doing their apps. But, differently to others, we are not thinking in us being PAAS. Better, we will use the power of cloud providers so that, using your credentials and API keys, you can use this app to push new versions of your app. 


Current Status
----------

This project is fairly new. This is a list of what has been done:

- Create forms
- Added Input field
- Added Textarea field
- Added Dropdown field
- Added Number field

This is in progress:
